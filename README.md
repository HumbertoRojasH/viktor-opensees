# VIKTOR-OpenseesPy
This sample app shows how to parametrically analyze a reinforced concrete building based on a frame structural system, using the finite element package OpenseesPy as a calculation engine.

The goal of the application is to show how the VIKTOR platform is used to provide a graphical interface to OpenseePy-based code. This application shows in a parameterized way the structural analysis of reinforced concrete buildings, applying static analysis and spectral modal analysis in order to know the seismic response of the building in a simplified way.

Although this app only shows analysis in the linear range of the building, it could be extended to perform nonlinear analysis such as PushOver or a Nonlinear Dynamic Analysis.

A published version of this app is available on [demo.viktor.ai](https://students-uni-fic-pe.viktor.ai/public/viktor-opensees)
